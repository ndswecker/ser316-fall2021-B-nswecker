Reading the given code (10 points)
Five things that I would change
	1. Creating a bear requires first desginating the stuffing. I think bear creation should happen without being dependent on stuffing type.
	2. Adding a noise maker looks confusing to me. Having a default setting that puts the price at $5 may cause future problems. Specifiy the exact cost for the exact location.
	3. There are no getters or setters for the Customer class. Its hard to test customer if I have no access to their attributes.
	4. The compareTo method in Clothing has no description. I have no idea what this method is for, and so have no basis for how to test it.
	5. checkout() for BearWorkshop indicates an age restriction on purchasing. I have no idea why this exists.

Task 1
	10. Which implementation adheres to the specification best?
	Answer: implementation 1, 3, and 4 past 15 out of 17 tests, while 0 and 2 past 14 out of 17. Obviously none passed all tests.
	11. List errors found
		a. app does not properly calculate the 10% discount for 10+ paid accessories
		b. app does not always calculate the correct ink costs for embroidery
		c. app does not always calcute the free ink discount for $70+ bears
