Reading the given code (10 points)
Five things that I would change
	1. Creating a bear requires first desginating the stuffing. I think bear creation should happen without being dependent on stuffing type.
	2. Adding a noise maker looks confusing to me. Having a default setting that puts the price at $5 may cause future problems. Specifiy the exact cost for the exact location.
	3. There are no getters or setters for the Customer class. Its hard to test customer if I have no access to their attributes.
	4. The compareTo method in Clothing has no description. I have no idea what this method is for, and so have no basis for how to test it.
	5. checkout() for BearWorkshop indicates an age restriction on purchasing. I have no idea why this exists.
